        <b>Cognizant</b>, Teaneck, NJ <br>
        Quality Assurance Engineer, August 2021 – February 2023<br>
        Subcontracted through <b>comcast </b>, Mount Laurel, NJ

    <ul>
        <li>
            Give daily updates in morning scrum stand ups for the end-to-end testing team.
        </li>

        <li> Validate the latest RDKB builds as they are released. <br>
            -Download latest firmware off the website <br>
            -Upload Firmware to server <br>
            -Use Git bash command to factory reset the device  <br>
            -Use a different Git Bash command to download the firmware to the device I’m working with clocking the time it takes for the device to go offline, and then come back on with the correct firmware. <br>
            -Create test customer accounts and go through the device activation process as if I was a new Xfinity customer using four different activation methods Sign up sign in (SUSI), Tech 360, Einstein, and the Xfinity app. Clocking the time it takes for the device to go online.
            </li>

        <li>Take the times I noted down and plug them into an excel sheet to generate graphs and to calculate total time of activation. If average total time is 30 seconds greater than the last build, I raise a ticket in Jira for development team. </li>
        
        <li>Take graphs and times and plug them into a power point and email out my findings to the development team including a link to Jira ticket if applicable.</li>

        <b><u>Academic Projects </u></b><br>
        <b>Eastern Michigan University </b>, Ypsilanti, MI <br>
        Software Engineering Course, Winter 2020 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Developer in building an app titled Little Bands for senior project.</li>
        <li>Collaborated in a team using Scrum methodology, where we facilitated two stand ups per week to check in on progress and deliverables, wrote user stories, and took turns acting as the project manager and scrum masters.</li>
        <li>Worked with a teammate to implement a dynamic data path so that when the user exits the app their save data is not lost.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Database Principles, Winter 2020</p>

    <ul>
        <li> Built a database for a fictional mail service to track when a customer drops off a package, lets customer track a package, and lets customer know when package is delivered.</li>
        <li> Used popular database schema design to build out an outline of the database I thought up.</li>
        <li>Used Microsoft SQL server to implement and test the database.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Computational Discrete Computing, Winter 2019</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Built a program in java that uses Warshall’s algorithm to find shortest paths in n x n matrix submitted by user in an external text file, the program also tells you how long it took to complete in milli seconds. </li>
        <li>Wrote a java program to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest bath between nodes on an n x n matrix represented by 1’s and 0’s. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Data Structures and Algorithms, Fall 2018</p>


    <ul>
        <li>Built databases using Sorted arrays, linked lists, and data trees with Java in eclipse.</li>
        <li>Used java to write three advanced sorting algorithms Quicksort, Heapsort, and Marge Sort then timed it with a sorted list, random list, and a list that was sorted in reverse order to time best- and worst-case scenario. </li>
    </ul>
